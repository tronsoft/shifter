# Shifter
Shifter, a lightweight IoC container

## Project description
Shifter is an inversion of control (IoC) container. It is design as a very lightweight container. It is written in c#.

Right now it supports constructor, field, property and method injection. Recently I added Windows Phone 8. Now you can implement dependency injection with Shifter on your Windows 8 phone!

I hope you like it.

I have a blog where I will publish information. My blog is http://www.tronsoft.nl.
